												<b>BACKGROUND</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												I studied at Canterbury School of Architecture for both my degree and post graduate qualification. On qualifying I accepted the position of architect assistant with a practice in the British Virgin Islands. Twenty five years ago, after working with several companies of different sizes, from a one man band to the internationally acclaimed firm Onions Bouchard and McCullock, I set up as a sole practitioner. I have thirty years of experience in design through to full project management of residential, office and resort projects. I have been fortunate enough to be involved in some high end projects. I now live in Devon and specialise exclusively in homes.
											</p>
											<p>
												Regardless of the size or intricacy of the work, nothing gives me more pleasure than to see my clients happy.

												<b>HOW I SEE IT</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												It is the client's home. It is not my showcase. My job is to divine their needs, compare them to what is possible and advise on space possibilities - light and volume are my primary tools. It is also my job to dress this property in a style that the owners are comfortable with, whether it be traditional, standard, contemporary or abstract.
											</p>
											<p>
												Colour and texture, the material finishes, are secondary tools. In my experience, many owners already have strong ideas of how they wish to personalise their home. My advice to anyone considering a building project, even if only remodelling a room, is to make a scrap book of what you would like to discuss with your designer. Words conjure different details to different people, images help define the words we use to describe things.
											</p>

											<b>WHAT TO EXPECT</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											Before any engagement there is an initial consultation, preferably on site, for all potential clients. This will be followed by a fee quotation letter which outlines the scope of work. Fees are generally fixed price and based on a percentage of the building cost. With contentious projects, like some listed buildings, this may not always be possible and hourly rates may need to be negotiated. Once the fee quotation is confirmed and accepted, and before I undertake a schematic design, we work together to develop a full brief. For a new house this will require several more meetings preferably in your existing home.
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>SPACE CONSULTANCY</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											This is a full or half day consultancy for people who are planning a remodelling project, on a limited budget that will not require permissions. Some kitchen and bathroom showrooms offer similar, however it is their prime objective to sell. Less is sometimes more and expensive does not necessarily mean appropriate. I like to take a holistic approach in that I consider the whole house and the needs of the family within not just the space under consideration: if storage is a problem throughout the house then a new bathroom can also be a chance to gain a little more.
										</p>
										<p>
											Sometimes, over the years a house just loses its mojo. Everything is slightly wrong, sad and tired: the spaces don't fit your life, it's frustrating, there is too much to tackle at once and the DIY enthusiast becomes over whelmed. I can offer an overall, prioritized, plan to help you on the right path.

										<p>
											Horizontal and vertical lines change the way we perceive things. A room will appear to stretch along the length of the line. The correct use of lines can enlarge the appearance of a room.
